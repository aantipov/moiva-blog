## The History of releases
Before I explain how and what was done to achieve the current milestone, I think it can be interesting to briefly look at the not a long history of Moiva.io.

### October 2020: the Idea was born 
I have being actively looking for ideas where to apply my knowledge and skills since March. The idea finally came to me one night when I was trying to fall asleep.

I had not seen a good javascript framework comparison tool even though the topic was always hot and many articles were written trying to solve it, gathering and analyzing data from many different sources. Also many different surveys were conducted to answer similar quistion - which framework/library to pick.

So I thought it was worth building a tool that will accumulate, analyze and show always up-to-date data and help developers pick the right tool. 

### 1st of December 2020: Release on ProductHunt
I was actively working on my idea before and after my day job. After almost 1.5 month of work I decided it's time to show the project to the public and gather some feedback.

I published it on [ProductHunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/jsdiff).


Lanyon is an unassuming [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme that places content first by tucking away navigation in a hidden drawer. It's based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com), the Jekyll butler.
