Hi, Alexey is here. I have some exciting news for you.

I rewrote [Moiva.io](https://moiva.io/) from scratch and made it a universal and flexible tool to suit every software developer's taste be it a JavaScript, Python or [put your favourite language here] developer.

This article marks a third major release of Moiva.

## What's new (in short)
- ability to search for and get data for any GitHub repository (don't worry, you can still search and compare Npm packages the same way).
- possibility to add relatevily easy Search, Suggestion and Comparison for other languages packages like [Maven](https://mvnrepository.com/) (Java), [PIP](https://pypi.org/) (Python) or [Packagist](https://packagist.org/) (PHP).
- Moiva got [open-sourced](https://github.com/aantipov/moiva)

## The History of releases
Before I explain how and what was done to achieve the current milestone, I think it can be interesting to briefly look at the not a long history of Moiva.io.

### October 2020: the Idea was born 
I have being actively looking for ideas where to apply my knowledge and skills since March. The idea finally came to me one night when I was trying to fall asleep.

I had not seen a good javascript framework comparison tool even though the topic was always hot and many articles were written trying to solve it, gathering and analyzing data from many different sources. Also many different surveys were conducted to answer similar quistion - which framework/library to pick.

So I thought it was worth building a tool that will accumulate, analyze and show always up-to-date data and help developers pick the right tool. 

### 1st of December 2020: Release on ProductHunt
I was actively working on my idea before and after my day job. After almost 1.5 month of work I decided it's time to show the project to the public and gather some feedback.

I published it on [ProductHunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/jsdiff).


Lanyon is an unassuming [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme that places content first by tucking away navigation in a hidden drawer. It's based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com), the Jekyll butler.

### Built on Poole

Poole is the Jekyll Butler, serving as an upstanding and effective foundation for Jekyll themes by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo). Poole, and every theme built on it (like Lanyon here) includes the following:

* Complete Jekyll setup included (layouts, config, [404](/404), [RSS feed](/index.xml), posts, and [example page](/about))
* Mobile friendly design and development
* Easily scalable text and component sizing with `rem` units in the CSS
* Support for a wide gamut of HTML elements
* Related posts (time-based, because Jekyll) below each post
* Syntax highlighting, courtesy Pygments (the Python-based code snippet highlighter)

### Lanyon features

In addition to the features of Poole, Lanyon adds the following:

* Toggleable sliding sidebar (built with only CSS) via **â˜°** link in top corner
* Sidebar includes support for textual modules and a dynamically generated navigation with active link support
* Two orientations for content and sidebar, default (left sidebar) and [reverse](https://github.com/poole/lanyon#reverse-layout) (right sidebar), available via `<body>` classes
* [Eight optional color schemes](https://github.com/poole/lanyon#themes), available via `<body>` classes

[Head to the readme](https://github.com/poole/lanyon#readme) to learn more.

### Browser support

Lanyon is by preference a forward-thinking project. In addition to the latest versions of Chrome, Safari (mobile and desktop), and Firefox, it is only compatible with Internet Explorer 9 and above.

### Download

Lanyon is developed on and hosted with GitHub. Head to the <a href="https://github.com/poole/lanyon">GitHub repository</a> for downloads, bug reports, and features requests.

Thanks!
